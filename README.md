# JJR Bookstore
A retail bookstore e-commerce app with various options to interact locally.

## Project Description & Usage
During KU's Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp, we discovered a shared passion for literature and wanted to embark on a daring adventure to open an online community for book lovers. Our journey serves as a testament to the transformative power of friendship, dedication, and the pursuit of dreams.

## Roadmap
We had several project "sprinkle" items that we would like to continue development on. Some of them listed below:
* Literary Quotes - that scroll or have small modals for daily inspiration. 
* User Profile - allow photo or avatar for users to upload and change within their profile view and access
* Events Page - create an Events page with calendar options, including but not limited to, upcoming events at the bookstore, request for rental space for reading room at the bookstore, form to request an event be held at or by the bookstore
* A "MUST READ" section that is curated by an "employee" or staff once a month or seasonally.
* A Kids Corner page that is a more kid-friendly UI and UX, including but not limited to, full page coloring pages for those days mom or dad are busy and kids need a safe activity on a secure site, suggested reading, summer reading list, upcoming storytime etc.
